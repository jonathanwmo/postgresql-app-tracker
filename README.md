The purpose of this wiki is to help future viewers of this repository 
understand the functions of the website and overall project. The website is

The project is laid out in a basic directory format with \src containing python, 
shell script, HTML, and CSS code as well as graph images. The \exportToHTML directory

    -   \graphs (contains directories for all countries)
        -   afghanistan (contains .png images of all 5 types of graphs)
            -   afghanistan_allfour_2020-07-23.png
